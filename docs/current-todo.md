- osc and biquad freq should go lower. maybe this slider should be log?
- more node types
  1. WaveshaperNode
  2. ConvolverNode
  3. DynamicsCompressorNode
  4. Chorus/Flanger/Phaser
  5. IIRFilterNode
- the add node buttons need to wrap since there will be more than can fit in one row
- mono mode (this should have the grid be just one channel and then split the output to stereo, mono should be the default, put the switch in the transport bar)
- we need to beef up the modulation.
  - we want to have two global LFOs
  - we want to have an envelope follower
  - every numeric parameter should have little buttons to enable LFO1 or LFO2 or ENV along with a small knob to control amount
- chaos needs to be a scaling factor for a bunch of params across current nodes. any available LFO values should be scaled up. filter q, delay feedback. chaos needs LFO knobs on itself as well.

- knobs don't update the value label
- more node types 2. ConvolverNode 3. DynamicsCompressorNode 4. Chorus/Flanger/Phaser 5. IIRFilterNode
- the add node buttons need to wrap since there will be more than can fit in one row
- finish modulation
  - we have two global LFOs and evelope followers that need a panel to adjust the rate and depth for lfo and the envelope follower source for the envelope followers
- chaos needs to be a scaling factor for a bunch of params across current nodes. any available LFO values should be scaled up. filter q, delay feedback. chaos needs LFO knobs on itself as well. chaos should be moved to the new global modulation panel
